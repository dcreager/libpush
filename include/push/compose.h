/**
 * Allocate and initialize a new callback that composes together two
 * child callbacks.  The first callback is allowed to parse the data
 * until it finishes, by returning a success or error code.
 * (PUSH_INCOMPLETE doesn't count as finishing the parse.)  Once the
 * first callback has finished, its result is used to activate the
 * second callback, at which point it is allowed to parse the
 * remaining data.  Once the second callback finishes, the
 * push_compose_t finishes.
 *
 * This combinator is equivalent to the Haskell
 * <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> arrow operator.
