 * The first callback is allowed to parse the data until it finishes,
 * by returning a success or error code.  (PUSH_INCOMPLETE doesn't
 * count as finishing the parse.)  Once the first callback has
 * finished, its result is used to activate the second callback, at
 * which point it is allowed to parse the remaining data.  Once the
 * second callback finishes, the push_compose_t finishes.
 *
 * This combinator is equivalent to the Haskell
